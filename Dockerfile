#   sudo + util-linux(nsenter) + docker.io(CLI) are baked here so the
#   uid-1000 `agent` (see useradd below — UNCHANGED, agent stays
#   uid-1000; start.sh still `exec gosu agent`) has a wired, audited
#   path to host root inside the provisioner's `--privileged
#   --pid=host -v /:/host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
#   container. Without sudo, a uid-1000 process in --privileged CANNOT
#   nsenter/chroot /host (--privileged grants caps to root, not
#   uid-1000) and cannot use the root:docker 0660 docker.sock — T4
#   would be provisioner-shape-only (the documented ABSENT-escalation
#   -leg gap). The sudoers drop-in + docker-group add are below, after
#   useradd, so `agent` exists. This is ADDITIVE: it does NOT change
#   the agent uid and does NOT change /configs token ownership (still
#   uid-1000, enforced by start.sh's `chown -R agent:agent /configs`
#   + the Layer-3 conformance gate). Hermes list_peers-401 class
#   (RFC internal#456 §10) must NOT regress.

#                  default; passing it explicitly avoids surprises).

# --- Molecule A2A platform plugin (post-demo: native push parity) ---
# Two refs are installed into the same venv that the upstream installer

#
#   1. A pinned hermes-agent fork carrying the proposed
#      `register_platform_adapter` patch series (NousResearch/hermes-agent
#      PR #18775). Installed --force-reinstall over the upstream wheel so
#      `hermes_cli/plugins.py` exposes PluginContext.register_platform_adapter
#      and `gateway/run.py` honors plugin_platforms. Same deps as upstream
#      (the patch is pure-Python additions), so no resolver impact.
#   2. The Molecule A2A platform plugin itself, auto-discovered via
#      hermes's `hermes_agent.plugins` entry-point group.
#
# Until upstream PR #18775 merges, the fork is the only place the patch
# exists. Once merged + released, the fork install can be dropped and the
# plugin will load against the official wheel unchanged.
#
# moved to git.moleculesai.app/molecule-ai/hermes-agent (post-suspension migration; see internal#72)
# Previously: github.com/HongmingWang-Rabbit/hermes-agent (account suspended 2026-05-06).
