# Pin by digest, not tag — avoids surprise base-bumps. Pairs with the
# Trivy gate in molecule-ci/.github/workflows/publish-template-image.yml
# (PR #35): pin avoids unexpected upgrade, Trivy catches if the pinned
# digest accumulates fixable HIGH/CRITICAL vulns over time. Bump
# deliberately by re-resolving:
#   docker pull --platform linux/amd64 python:3.11-slim
#   docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' python:3.11-slim
# Last resolved: 2026-05-03 (RFC #388 PR-2b).

#      PR #18775). Installed --force-reinstall over the upstream wheel so
#      `hermes_cli/plugins.py` exposes PluginContext.register_platform_adapter
#      and `gateway/run.py` honors plugin_platforms. Same deps as upstream
#      (the patch is pure-Python additions), so no resolver impact.
#   2. The Molecule A2A platform plugin itself, auto-discovered via
#      hermes's `hermes_agent.plugins` entry-point group.
#
# Until upstream PR #18775 merges, the fork is the only place the patch
# exists. Once merged + released, the fork install can be dropped and the
# plugin will load against the official wheel unchanged.
